			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<p>The series revolves around Geralt of Rivia, a skilled monster hunter, and his adventures in a fantasy world of magic, political intrigue, and dangerous creatures. The gameplay mainly focuses on exploration, combat, and decision-making as the player navigates Geralt in the game world, completing quests, and fighting enemies. The series is known for its intricate narratives, morally ambiguous choices, and attention to detail in creating rich and immersive worlds for players to explore.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The games are represented in a third-person view perspective in a partially open world environment. During the game, the player is faced with difficult decisions that affect the ending of the story and the game world. The choices players make in The Witcher games can have immediate and long-term consequences, affecting relationships between characters, opening up new quests and storylines.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The quests have multiple solutions and branching paths, depending on the player's choices, adding to the game's replayability and encouraging exploration. Many quests involve interacting with NPCs and building relationships with them, which can lead to different outcomes and branching paths in the story. The series also features a variety of quest types, including main story quests, side quests, contracts, and treasure hunts. Each quest type offers a unique challenge and reward, ranging from advancing the story to obtaining rare loot or unlocking new areas.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Potions are consumable items that Geralt can use to temporarily enhance his abilities. Players can choose which skills to invest in based on their preferred playstyle and customize Geralt's skills to their liking. In addition to potions and abilities, the game also includes equipment upgrades such as weapons and armor that can further enhance Geralt's abilities. Crafting and upgrading gear is another important aspect of the game where players must gather resources and work with crafters to create the gear that best suits Geralt's needs.</p>

			<h3 id="the-witcher">The Witcher</h3>
			<p>In 1996 and 1997, a Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin) video game was being developed by Metropolis Software in Poland, but it was canceled. The game's director was Adrian Chmielarz, former People Can Fly co-owner and creative director, who coined the translation "The Witcher" during its development. According to Chmielarz, the game would have been a 3D action-adventure game with role-playing elements such as moral choices and experience points.[4]</p>
			<br>
			<p>n 2003, Polish video-game developer CD Projekt Red negotiated with Sapkowski for rights to The Witcher, given the languishing work at Metropolis,[5] and released The Witcher, a role-playing game based on the saga in October 2007 for personal computers. It was well-publicized and, although it was the developer's first game, it received critical praise in Europe and North America. The Witcher was published in Poland by CD Projekt and worldwide by Atari. A console version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf with the same story and a different engine and combat system, was scheduled for release in fall 2009 but was canceled that spring. The game's story takes place around five years after the events of the main book saga.</p>
			<br>

			<h3 id="the-witcher2">The Witcher 2:Assassins of Kings</h3>
			<p>The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings (Polish: Wiedźmin 2: Zabójcy królów) is the sequel to The Witcher, developed by CD Projekt Red. On 16 September 2009, before Assassins of Kings was introduced, a video of the game was leaked;[6] two days later, CD Projekt Red confirmed that it was in development.[7] Assassins of Kings was published in Poland by CD Projekt, by Namco Bandai Games in Europe and by Atari in North America. The game was also distributed digitally through Steam and DRM-free on Good Old Games. It takes place around half a year after the events of the first game.</p>
			<br>

			<h3 id="the-witcher3">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>

			<h3 id="the-witcher4">Project Polaris</h3>
			<p>Polaris is a codename for the next installment in The Witcher series. It will use Unreal Engine 5 instead of REDengine, which the two previous games used.[1] The game is to be the beginning of a new saga.

			<p>The series had sold over 33 million units by March 2018,[36] increasing to over 50 million units by May 2020.[37] As of March 2023, the series has sold over 75 million units, of which over 50 million were of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.[38] The total makes it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time.[39]</p>
			<h3 id="apd">Author payment demands</h3>
			<p>In October 2018, Sapkowski sent notice to CD Projekt demanding he be remunerated for sales of The Witcher video games, asking for more than 60 million Polish złoty (more than US$15 million) representing between about 5% and 15% of the game's revenues over the years. Sapkowski had originally provided the license to CD Projekt based on a lump sum payment, but now believes he is due more since the series has become much more successful than expected. CD Projekt stated that while they had met all obligations on the initial acquisition of the license, they will work amicably with Sapkowski's legal representatives to come to a fair outcome for all parties.[40] By February 2019, CD Projekt worked out a settlement agreement that would provide Sapkowski additional royalties for their video game series, though not as great as those Sapkowski had asked for, as to maintain a working relationship with the author for future Witcher projects.[41] The settlement was finalized by December 2019.[42]</p>
